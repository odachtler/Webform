# Olivia Dachtler's Webform
This project used elements to create a static webform that implemented two pages and multiple types of questions.

# Purpose

This webform conformed to best practices in three main ways: alt image text, colors, and amount of questions asked. These three elements combine to make the webform accessible and increase the likelihood that viewers will fill out the entirety of the webform.

---
By having alt image text on the homepage, it allows viewers who use a screenreader to be able to visualize what is on the page. This increases accessibility for the webform and the population. Alt image text is an easy addition to ensure that the webform is accessible to a wider audience. 

---
The colors chosen on the webform also allow people to see the text easily. When choosing colors, it is important to keep in mind that many viewers may be color blind or have a harder time seeing. Ensuring that the colors passed the WCAG 2.1 test helps the webform be more accessible to various groups of people. 

---
Finally, the amount of items the user had to fill out was kept to the bare minimum to ensure people wouldn't get annoyed with the amount they had to type. Each page has a maximum of 7 questions to fill out and most of them are easy, with given options rather than typing.
